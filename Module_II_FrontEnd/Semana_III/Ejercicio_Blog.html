      <!-- FIRST paragraph -->

        Blogging is far from dead. As the last two years of X-formerly-Twitter drama
        has shown, allowing a social media platform to control your access to your
        audience
        <a class="link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/mar/26/twitter-usage-in-us-fallen-by-a-fifth-since-elon-musks-takeover">
          has big risks.
        </a>.
        If you want a platform where you can share your thoughts properly and keep
        control of things, it's impossible to beat a blog. Plus, you can always share
        your blog posts on social media, through a newsletter, and anywhere else.
        The whole point of a blog is that it's your content to do with as you will.

        Similarly, if you run a business and want to provide resources and recommendations
        to customers, the best way to do it is often to add a blog to your website. Best of all,
        your blog content gets indexed by Google—unlike almost all social media posts—so you
        can drive potential customers to your business through content marketing (and without
        having to pay for ads). Look at the blog you're reading right now: Zapier blog posts get
        millions of views per month and are one of the most valuable ways of getting new
        customers at Zapier.

        After testing all the most popular blog sites out there, these are the five best.
        And yes, two of them are WordPress, but there are a few great WordPress alternatives
        in here too.

        Blogs have been around since the earliest days of the internet, so most people have a pretty solid idea of what one is—even if they've never really thought to spell it out. Here's how I think about it: a blog is a website, maybe with a few other pages, but the most important part is the feed of blog posts in reverse chronological order. 

        There's a thin line between the software you need to create a blog and the kind of content management systems (CMS) used by large companies to power their websites. Many tools like WordPress and Drupal can be used to both build a blog or power a regular website (or do both at once).

        When I was putting together this list, I used two criteria to decide on the essential blog-iness of the tools I was testing. 
        They had to make it quick and easy to set up a real blog, and the backend where you write blog posts had to be nice to use and fully-featured. Squarespace, for example, is a great website builder that makes it possible to build a blog, but it's not particularly intuitive to set up, and the backend is awful to use. 
        Drupal is an incredible CMS, but it's just too hard for non-developers to get started with to really be considered a universal blogging platform. I've tried it—it's just not worth the hassle for most people. WordPress, on the other hand, is both quick and easy for a regular human to launch a blog—and the backend is intuitive and great to use.
